This project develops a Machine Learning model for disease classification prediction based on symptoms and factors. It explores data preprocessing techniques, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Methodology
1. Data acquisition and preprocessing.
2. Model selection (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc.).
3. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
4. Model performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Results
* Model accuracy: 95%

* The most important features are: dizziness, abdominal pain, headache, etc.


## Limitations
The dataset used has limitations in representing certain diseases, affecting the modelâ€™s ability to predict them accurately.

## Next Steps

* Obtain a more comprehensive and representative dataset.
* Explore more advanced Machine Learning techniques.
* Develop an accessible and user-friendly diagnostic tool.

## Usage Instructions
